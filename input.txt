Qarib Qarib Singlle
Tanuja Chandra
Jaya and Yogi set out on a short journey to retrace past relationships and end up in the most eventful, strange, crazy trip of their lives. This short journey through Rishikesh, Bikaner and Gangtok with the ups and downs, the missed trains and taxi rides, the heartbreak and the mending of old friendships, the quarrels and self-discovery, sweeps Jaya and Yogi away, and indeed us as well, into a very special and unforgettable experience. And do they fall in love? We really hope so.

Suburbicon
George Clooney
Suburbicon is a peaceful, idyllic suburban community with affordable homes and manicured lawns…the perfect place to raise a family, and in the summer of 1959, the Lodge family is doing just that. But the tranquil surface masks a disturbing reality, as husband and father Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) must navigate the town’s dark underbelly of betrayal, deceit, and violence. This is a tale of very flawed people making very bad choices. This is Suburbicon.

So, basically it would be interesting to hear how others go about for having your Eclipse IDE display the javadoc property description for your getters - without having to duplicate the javadoc comment.

Then, I'm done. In my opinion, this templating makes it a lot easier, in the long run, to not only remind yourself what the property means through repetition, but also it makes it easier to add additional comments to the getter and setter if you want to add side effects (such as not allowing null properties, turning strings to uppercase, etc).
